# scienceplus-content

https://scienceplus.abes.fr contains more than 6 000 000 bibliographic records of scientific publications. Its current content is detailed in this [TSV file](https://github.com/abes-esr/scienceplus-content/blob/main/scienceplus_graphes_corpus.tsv).

Metadata were provided by various publishers (in XML), then converted to RDF and enriched by Abes. Metadata enrichments focused on the linking of author names to https://www.idref.fr/ and https://orcid.org/.

https://scienceplus.abes.fr is a work in progress. Content and services will develop to meet the needs of the French higher education community, but international feedback and cooperation are highly appreciated.
